sudo apt install redis-server
```

Configurations used from file `data/redis.conf`, no more steps need.


# Use

## Set python environment

use the `shells/create_environ.sh` script for create the python environment.

```
bash shells/create_environ.sh
```

You can see inside the script for the step by step commands.


## Play app

Use the `shells/run_app.sh` script for setting the environment variables, start redis server and play the application. redis-server configuration files is at `data/`, the cached data will be stored at `data/cache.rdb`. 

```
bash shells/run_app.sh
```

```

Note: cached data will be deleted after CACHE_TIME_SECONDS seconds.

## Play test

For make all the tests first initiate the app in one terminal and the test in other terminal:

```
# terminal 1
bash shells/run_app.sh
```

```
# terminal 2
bash shells/test.sh
```
